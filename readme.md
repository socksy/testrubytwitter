# A *very* simple barebone twitter client in Ruby
To run, you need to first create a new file called `authdetails.sh`. This will 
have all of the needed API keys and access tokens. In particular, it should
have:

    export TEST_SOURCED_RET3453=1
    export CONSUMER_KEY="your consumer key here"
    export CONSUMER_SECRET="your consumer secret here"
    export ACCESS_TOKEN="your access token here"
    export ACCESS_SECRET="your access token secret here"
